<h1 align="center">Hello World</h1>
<p>I program for both hobby and profession. It helps me when I can't sleep at night. It obsesses me to materialize my idea into code lines. Sometimes I can create an app in Kotlin for Android, and other times, I can build an exploit in Python, why not? If I wanna be like Mr. Robot, I'll be, even though I have no idea about how TCP/IP works. I grew up, live, and will probably die doing this until an super artificial intelligence absorbs my mind and I could live on some random cloud server on a random digital world, just like an episode of Black Mirror, y'know.</p>

<p>I hate web design, but if you pay me well, maybe I'll reconsider. </p>

<p>You can copy, save, replicate, and use any repository from here, just as Microsoft does without my explicit authorization.</p>
<p>Whatever...</p>
